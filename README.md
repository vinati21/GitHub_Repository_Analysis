# GitHub Repository Analysis
## Title: Grouping the GitHub repositories and predicting the technology it is built in based on the repository features.

## Statement of the project problem: 

GitHub contains various types of repositories which may or may not correspond to individual projects and also, they could correspond to different types of software languages. Each repository will a have a purpose and could be different from one another. It is very important to understand the trends and characteristics of the repositories based on which we can filter the repositories and classify them into technology classes.

## Objectives of the project: 
1.To understand the trends of the GitHub repositories.
2.To explore the similarities and dissimilarities among the GitHub repositories.
3.To identify different groups based on purpose of creation of repositories.
4.To predict the technology on which the repository was built in.

## Data Description:

I have collected GitHub transactional data for the month of April in 2014.I have filtered repository data and collected repository features. We have a mixed type of data containing textual data, categorical data and discrete count data. Each of them have to be processed differently to encode them and use them for our analysis. The data we will be working on has about 500k rows and 5000 features.

## Workflow Design and Methodology:
