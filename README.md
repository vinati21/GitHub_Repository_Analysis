# GitHub_Repository_Analysis
# Title: Grouping the GitHub repositories and predicting the technology it is built in based on the repository features.

# Introduction : 
In my previous research on GitHub repositories, I have considered all the repositories that are in GitHub from 2011 to 2014. GitHub could contain various types of repositories which may or may not contribute to the software. It is very important to identify these repositories and not include them for the team size analysis corresponding to software. Therefore, we need to filter the repositories useful to us removing all the student project and non-useful repositories.

# Statement of the project problem: 

GitHub contains various types of repositories which may or may not correspond to individual projects and also, they could correspond to different types of software languages. Each repository will a have a purpose and could be different from one another. It is very important to understand the trends and characteristics of the repositories based on which we can filter the repositories and classify them into technology classes.

# Objectives of the study: 
1.To understand the trends of the GitHub repositories.
2.To explore the similarities and dissimilarities among the GitHub repositories.
3.To identify different groups based on purpose of creation of repositories.
4. To predict the technology on which the repository was built in.
