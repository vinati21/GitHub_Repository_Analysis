# How to Contribute to Dython
If you'd like to contribute or assist - then first of all, thanks. This isn't obvious and I appreciate it.

## If you found a bug:
* First, make sure you do not use Python 2.x. Dython does not support it.
* Please make sure there's no open issue regarding this, and no closed issue explaining why this isn't a bug.
* If the above doesn't apply, open a new issue. Please make sure to explain _exactly_ how you reached the bug, and 
make sure to add any input and code fractions required to recreate it.

## If you would like to add a feature or merge a bug fix:
* Before anything, make sure to test your code. Remember that Dython doesn't support Python 2.x.
* Please make sure there's an issue open regarding the issue you address.
* Explain on the issue's page what does your change affect.
* After an approval was received on the issue page, open a pull request
